### MySQL8 replication config

The error message indicates that the authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' is requiring a secure connection, which isn't established in our current setup. There are two main ways to address this:

1. Use a secure connection (SSL/TLS)
2. Change the authentication method for the replication user

For simplicity, we'll go with the second option. Here's how to fix it:

1. On the master server, change the authentication method for the replication user:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it mysql-master mysql -uroot -p
   ```

   Once in the MySQL shell:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'repl'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'slavepass';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

2. Now, let's update our Docker Compose file to include the necessary SSL settings for future use:



```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  mysql-master:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql-master
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: masterpassword
    volumes:
      - ./master/data:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./master/conf:/etc/mysql/conf.d
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

  mysql-slave:
    image: mysql:8.0
    container_name: mysql-slave
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: slavepassword
    volumes:
      - ./slave/data:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./slave/conf:/etc/mysql/conf.d
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"
    depends_on:
      - mysql-master
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

```

3. Update the master configuration file (master/conf/my.cnf):

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   server-id=1
   log-bin=mysql-bin
   binlog-format=ROW
   skip-ssl
   ```

4. Update the slave configuration file (slave/conf/my.cnf):

   ```ini
   [mysqld]
   server-id=2
   relay-log=slave-relay-bin
   skip-ssl
   ```

5. Restart the Docker containers to apply these changes:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. Now, reconfigure the slave to use the updated replication user:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it mysql-slave mysql -uroot -p
   ```

   In the MySQL shell:

   ```sql
   STOP SLAVE;
   CHANGE MASTER TO
   MASTER_HOST='mysql-master',
   MASTER_USER='repl',
   MASTER_PASSWORD='slavepass',
   MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',
   MASTER_LOG_POS=XXX;

   START SLAVE;
   SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
   ```

   Replace 'mysql-bin.000001' and XXX with the current File and Position from the master's SHOW MASTER STATUS output.

These changes should resolve the authentication error. The key modifications are:

1. Changing the replication user's authentication method to 'mysql_native_password'.
2. Adding `--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password` to both master and slave configurations in the Docker Compose file.
3. Adding `skip-ssl` to both master and slave MySQL configurations to explicitly disable SSL for now.

After applying these changes, the slave should be able to connect to the master without the secure connection error. However, for a production environment, it's recommended to set up proper SSL/TLS connections between master and slave for enhanced security.

Let me know if you encounter any other issues or if you'd like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail.


I see you're encountering an authentication error when trying to connect the slave to the master. This error is common when setting up MySQL 8.0+ replication due to changes in the default authentication method. Let's resolve this issue step by step.
